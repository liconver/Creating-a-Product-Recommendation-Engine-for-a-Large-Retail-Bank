# Product-Recommendation-Project

Here I created multiple product recommendation models for the Santander Product Recommendation Kaggle Competition.  

Included in this repository is multiple Jupyter notebooks showing the early stages of data cleaning and EDA, as well many different iterations of different types of recommendation models.  Also there is the project report and slide show.  The 'Model Notebooks' folder includes some of the additional models I was working on that didn't work out so well.  All of the models discussed in the report and slides are in the main part of the repository.
